I have successfully created a Flutter app that integrates with the reqres.in API. I have connected to the /api/users?page=2 endpoint for retrieving user data and the /api/users endpoint for creating new users. The API integration is now visible through a basic UI.

The app allows users to view a list of users by making a GET request to the /api/users?page=2 endpoint. The response data is displayed in a user-friendly format on the app's interface. Users can scroll through the list to view all the available users.

Additionally, the app provides a functionality for creating new users. Users can enter the required information in the provided form fields and submit it. The app sends a POST request to the /api/users endpoint with the entered data to create a new user.

The integration with the reqres.in API has been successfully implemented, and the app provides a seamless user experience with a clean and intuitive UI. Users can effortlessly view and create users using the app.

The app too can be found in the android folder.
